          <h4>Angular</h4>
          <p>Angular is a modern framework built entirely in TypeScript, and as a result, using TypeScript with Angular provides a seamless experience.</p>
          <p>I am most excited about angular is the MVC. The MVC is the Model-View-Controller pattern. I did some research on Angular and that seemed really cool. This allows Angular to do a lot of the work for you. That also connects with the HTML template and opens up a new way to do a lot of new cool things. Angular also saves a lot of time because it will automate repetitive tasks that you have. I am excited to learn about everything but Angular stood out most to me.</p>
